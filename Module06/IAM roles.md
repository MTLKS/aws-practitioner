An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions.

Before an [[IAM users|IAM user]], application or service can assume an IAM role, they must be granted permissions to switch to the role. When someone assumes an IAM role, they abandon all previous permissions that they had under a previous role and assume the permissions of the new role.
