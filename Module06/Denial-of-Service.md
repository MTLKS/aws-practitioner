### Denial-of-Service attacks
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users. An attacker might flood the website or application with excessive network traffic until it becomes overloaded and is no longer able to respond. This denies service to users who are trying to make legitimate requests.

### Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks
In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, multiple sources are used to start an attack that aims to make a website or application unavailable. The attacker can use multiple infected computers (a.k.a. bots) to send excessive traffic to a website or application.

To help minimize the effect of DoS and DDoS attacks, you can use [[AWS Shield]].
