# Amazon EC2

#essentials 

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.

Benefits:
- You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
- You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
- You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
- You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
