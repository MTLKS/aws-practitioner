# AWS CodeArtifact

[CodeArtifact](https://aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/) allows you to store artifacts using popular package managers and build tools like Maven, Gradle, npm, Yarn, Twine, pip, NuGet, and SwiftPM. CodeArtifact can automatically fetch software packages on demand from public package repositories so you can access the latest versions of application dependencies.
