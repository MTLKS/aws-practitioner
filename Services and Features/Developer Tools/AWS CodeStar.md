# AWS CodeStar

[AWS CodeStar](https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/) enables you to quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. AWS CodeStar provides a unified user interface, enabling you to easily manage your software development activities in one place.

Note to self:
Seems like a similar product to Azure DevOps as a whole, but getting discontinued and replaced by Amazon CodeCatalyst.
