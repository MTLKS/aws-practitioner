# AWS AppConfig

[AWS AppConfig](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/appconfig/), a feature of [[AWS Systems Manager]], makes it easy for customers to quickly and safely configure, validate, and deploy feature flags and application configuration. Your feature flag and configurations data can be validated syntactically or semantically in the pre-deployment phase, and can be monitored and automatically rolled back if an alarm that you have configured is triggered. Using AWS AppConfig, you can make application changes safely, avoid errors in configuration changes, deploy changes across a set of targets quickly, and control deployment of changes across your applications.

Note to self:
