# Amazon Polly

[Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) uses deep learning technologies to synthesize natural-sounding human speech, so you can convert articles to speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, use Amazon Polly to build speech-activated applications.

## Use cases
### Generate speech in dozens of languages
Add speech to applications with a global audience, such as RSS feeds, websites, or videos.

### Engage customers with a natural-sounding voice
Store and replay Amazon Polly speech output to prompt callers through interactive or automated voice response systems.

### Adjust speaking style, speech rate, pitch, and loudness
Use SSML, a W3C standard XML-based markup language for speech synthesis applications, to support common SSML tags for phrasing, emphasis, and intonation.
