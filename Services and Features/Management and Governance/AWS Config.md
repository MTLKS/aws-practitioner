# AWS Config

[AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) continually assesses, audits, and evaluates the configurations and relationships of your resources on AWS, on premises, and on other clouds.

## Use cases
### Streamline operational troubleshooting and change management
Discover resources that exist in your account or publish the configuration data of third-party resources into AWS Config, record their configurations, and capture any changes to quickly troubleshoot operational issues.

### Deploy a compliance-as-code framework
Codify your compliance requirements as AWS Config rules and author remediation actions, automating the assessment of your resource configurations across your organization.

### Continually audit security monitoring and analysis
Evaluate resource configurations for potential vulnerabilities, and review your configuration history after potential incidents to examine your security posture.
