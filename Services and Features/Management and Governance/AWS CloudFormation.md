# AWS CloudFormation

#essentials 

[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) lets you model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code.
#### Essentials description:
An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define a wide variety of AWS resources in a declarative way using JSON or YAML text-based documents called CloudFormation templates. It provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner.

## Use cases
### Manage infrastructure with DevOps
Automate, test, and deploy infrastructure templates with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) automations.  

### Scale production stacks
Run anything from a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance to a complex multi-region application.  

### Share best practices
Define an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnet or provisioning services like AWS OpsWorks or Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with ease.
