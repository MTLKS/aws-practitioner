# AWS CloudTrail

#essentials 

[AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.

AWS CloudTrail records API calls for your account. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, and more. With AWS CloudTrail, you can view a complete history of user activity and API calls for your applications and resources.

Each record is called an event, and are typically updated in CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call.

### CloudTrail Insights
CloudTrail Insights is an optional feature that allows CloudTrail to automatically detect unusual API activities in your AWS account.
