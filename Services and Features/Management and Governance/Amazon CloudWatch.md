# Amazon CloudWatch

#essentials 

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) is a service that monitors applications, responds to performance changes, optimizes resource use, and provides insights into operational health. By collecting data across AWS resources, CloudWatch gives visibility into system-wide performance and allows users to set alarms, automatically react to changes, and gain a unified view of operational health.

#### Essentials description:
Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on the metrics. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch, which then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.

### CloudWatch alarms
Alarms automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold. For example, you can create an alarm that automatically stops an Amazon EC2 instance when the CPU utilization percentage has remained below a certain threshold for a specified period. You can also specify to receive a notification whenever this alarm is triggered.

### CloudWatch dashboard
This feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location. You can customize separate dashboards for different business purposes, applications, or resources.
