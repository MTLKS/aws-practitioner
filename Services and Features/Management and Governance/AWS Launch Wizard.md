# AWS Launch Wizard

[AWS Launch Wizard](https://aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/) offers a guided way of sizing, configuring, and deploying AWS resources for third party applications, such as Microsoft SQL Server Always On and HANA based SAP systems, without the need to manually identify and provision individual AWS resources.

AWS Launch Wizard also creates [[AWS CloudFormation|CloudFormation]] templates that can serve as a baseline to accelerate subsequent deployments. Launch Wizard is available to you at no additional charge. You only pay for the AWS resources that are provisioned for running your solution.
