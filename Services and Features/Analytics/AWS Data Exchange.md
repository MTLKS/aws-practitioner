# AWS Data Exchange

[AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) is the only data marketplace with more than 3,500 products from over 300 providers delivered —through files, APIs, or [[Amazon Redshift]] queries— directly to the data lakes, applications, analytics, and machine learning models that use it.

With AWS Data Exchange, you can streamline all third-party data consumption, from existing subscriptions —which you can migrate at no additional cost to you or the provider— to future data subscriptions, in one place.

As an AWS service, AWS Data Exchange is secure and compliant, integrated with AWS and third-party tools and services, and offers consolidated billing and subscription management.
