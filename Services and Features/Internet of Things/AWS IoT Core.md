# AWS IoT Core

[AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) lets you connect billions of IoT devices and route trillions of messages to AWS services without managing infrastructure.

AWS IoT Core provides a fully managed palette of MQTT-based messaging features, which can help you build adaptive IoT architectures that are cost efficient, reliable, and optimized for scale.
