Helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.

### Operational excellence
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Design principles include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.

### Security
The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

Apply these best practices:
- Automate security best practices when possible.
- Apply security at all layers.
- Protect data in transit and at rest.

### Reliability
The ability of a system to do the following:
- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions.
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

It includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.

### Performance efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### Cost optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. Includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.

### Sustainability
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
