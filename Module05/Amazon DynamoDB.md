Amazon DynamoDB is a non-relational database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

It is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. You also do not have to install, maintain, or operate software.

DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance.
