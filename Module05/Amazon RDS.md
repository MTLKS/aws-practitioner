Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.

Amazon RDS is a managed service that automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. You can integrate Amazon RDS with other services, such as [[AWS Lambda]].

Amazon RDS provides a number of different security options, such as encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored) and encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received).

### Amazon RDS database engines
Supported database engines include:
- Amazon Aurora
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server

#### Amazon Aurora
Amazon Aurora is an enterprise-class relational database, and is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and up to three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.

Amazon Aurora helps to reduce costs by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations, while ensuring that your database resources remain reliable and available.

It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to [[Amazon S3]].
