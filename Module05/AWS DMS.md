AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) enables you to migrate relational databases, non-relational databases, and other types of data stores.

The source and target databases can be of the same or different types. During the migration, the source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database.

Other use cases include:
- Development and test database migrations - Enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users.
- Database consolidation - Combining several databases into a single database.
- Continuous replication - Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration.
