A Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phone book of the internet. It translates domain names to an IP address.

For example, suppose that you want to visit AnyCompany's website.
- 1. When you enter the domain name into your browser, this request is sent to a customer DNS resolver.
- 2. The customer DNS resolver asks the company DNS server for the IP address that corresponds to AnyCompany's website.
- 3. The company DNS server responds by providing the IP address for AnyCompany's website, 192.0.2.0.
