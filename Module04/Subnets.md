Subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. Subnets can be public or private.

#### Public subnets
Contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store's website.

#### Private subnets
Contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network. In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. An example would be an [[Amazon EC2]] instance in a public subnet can communicate with databases in a private subnet.
