Amazon Route 53 is a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] web service. It connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS as well as infrastructure outside of AWS.

Another feature of Route 53 is the ability to manage the DNS records for domain names. You can register new domain names directly in Route 53 and also transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other domain registrars.
