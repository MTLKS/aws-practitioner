### Trade upfront expense for variable expense
Upfront expenses - data centers, physical servers
Variable expenses - only pay for computing resources that are consumed

Basically renting a server instead of buying a server.

### Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
Instead of spending money and time in managing infrastructure and servers, time can be spent on applications and customers.

### Stop guessing capacity
There is no need to predict how much infrastructure capacity is needed before deploying an application. It is possible to launch first, and scale in or scale out in response to demand.

### Benefit from massive economies of scale
Cloud providers can achieve higher economies of scale as more customers use them, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.

### Increase speed and agility
Cloud computing enables users to access new resources within minutes instead of weeks.

### Go global in minutes
AWS cloud enables users to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
