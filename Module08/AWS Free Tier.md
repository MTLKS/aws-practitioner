The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period.

Three types of offers are available:
- Always Free - These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.
- 12 Months Free - These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.
- Trials - Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.
