AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with pay-as-you-go pricing, and works in the following three categories:
- Pay for what you use.
- Pay less when you reserve.
- Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more.

### AWS Pricing Calculator
AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. 

For example, suppose you are not sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient to use Amazon EC2. You can enter details, such as the operating system, memory requirements, I/O requirements, into AWS Pricing Calculator, then review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS regions.
