### Serverless computing
"Serverless" means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on features instead of maintaining servers.

### AWS Lambda
An AWS service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. You only pay for the compute time that you consumed, charges apply only when you code is running.

#### How AWS Lambda works
- You upload your code to Lambda.
- You set your code to trigger from and event source, such as AWS services, mobile applications, or HTTP endpoints.
- Lambda runs your code only when triggered.
- You pay only for the compute time that you use.
