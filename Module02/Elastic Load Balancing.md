Elastic Load Balancing is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as [[Amazon EC2]] instances.

A load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your [[Scaling Amazon EC2|AutoScaling]] group. The requests route the the load balancer first, then spreads across multiple resources that will handle them.
