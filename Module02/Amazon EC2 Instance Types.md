### General purpose instance
Provides a balance of compute, memory and networking resources. Use them for a variety of workloads, such as application servers, gaming servers, backend servers for enterprise applications, and small and medium databases.

### Compute optimized instances
Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. Difference from the the general purpose instances is that compute optimized applications are ideal for high-performance web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers.

### Memory optimized instances
Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. Scenarios to use memory optimized instances include high-performance database or a workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data.

### Accelerated computing instances
Uses hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Examples include floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching.

### Storage optimized instances
Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. Examples include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.

Input/output operations per seconds (IOPS) is a metric that measures the performance of a storage device.
