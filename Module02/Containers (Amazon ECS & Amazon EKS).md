Containers provide you with a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single object.

### Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
A highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications. It supports Docker containers, the use of open-source Docker Community Edition and subscription-based Docker Enterprise Edition.

### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
A fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. Kubernetes is an open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

### AWS Fargate
A serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers, as it manages the server infrastructure for you.
