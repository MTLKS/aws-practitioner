Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a message queueing service. Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.

Two examples of how to use Amazon SQS:
- Fulfilling an order
- Orders in a queue
