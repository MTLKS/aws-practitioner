An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

### Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN), which is a service that helps deliver data, video, applications, and APIs to customers around the world with low latency and high transfer speeds.

### Amazon Route 53
AWS Edge locations also run a domain name service (DNS) that helps direct customers to the correct web locations with reliably low latency.

### Amazon Outposts
AWS can install a fully operational mini Region inside your own data center. It is owned and operated by AWS, using 100% of AWS functionality, but isolated within your own building.
