Four business factors for determining the right Region.

### Compliance
If your company requires all of its data to reside within a specific region, you would have to choose the region.

### Proximity
Selecting a Region close to your customers will help you get content to them faster.

### Available services
Sometimes the closest Region might not have all the features that you want. If you need a certain service that AWS provides, you will have to run it in one of the Regions that offers it.

### Pricing
The cost of services can vary from Region to Region due to several factors, for example the country's tax structure.
